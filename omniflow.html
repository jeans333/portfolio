            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>There is a constant struggle to juggle school work with personal life. Finding balance in hustle culture is a continuous learning curve for everyone, especially for students who are adjusting to workloads or managing schedules. 
            <br><br>
            Despite the numerous applications to help with time management and planning, we saw an opportunity to create an app that encourages a healthier digital lifestyle with students and professionals. With an emphasis on productivity and well being, Omniflow offers a custom-tailored experience for every user and their priorities.</p>

            <h2>Problem Space</h2>
            <p>We noticed that many students tend to be intimidated or discouraged from using workspace platforms. Staying on top of deadlines and completing daily to-do lists can be difficult, let alone spending an extensive amount of time to navigate a time-management app</p>

                <h3>Fear of missing out</h3>
                <p>Users can't focus on school or social life without feeling guilty about how they are spending time. Students from other campuses feel more isolated or less connected with peers. </p>

                <h3>Going back to old ways</h3>

            </div>

                <h3>Neglect of self care</h3>
                <p>When interviewing students, most said self care was not even on the list of priorities during school terms. Does self care and work have to be mutually exclusive?</p>

            <p class="therefore">We discovered the need to edit and add widgets barely occurred in the later parts of a users journey and it was simply blocking space on their dashboard. The placement also made it easier to accidentally click on it with our mobile prototype. When users were asked to rank the priorities of the default widgets, responsive were very subjective and it was difficult to meet all needs.</p>

            <p class="learning-outcome">This was one of my first team-based UX projects and I gained valuable insights on how different perspectives helped us understand our users better. I learned the importance of deeply understanding user needs through comprehensive research and empathetic engagement. This project not only developed my UI design skills, it also taught me how to effectively translate user data into actionable design solutions. Beyond the technical aspects, I found Omniflow really exciting through how it challenged my creative thinking and problem solving skills!</p>
