            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>There is a constant struggle to juggle school work with personal life. Finding balance in hustle culture is a continuous learning curve for everyone, especially for students who are adjusting to workloads or managing schedules. 
            <br><br>
            Despite the numerous applications to help with time management and planning, we saw an opportunity to create an app that encourages a healthier digital lifestyle with students and professionals. With an emphasis on productivity and well being, Omniflow offers a custom-tailored experience for every user and their priorities.</p>

            <h2>Problem Space</h2>
            <p>We noticed that many students tend to be intimidated or discouraged from using workspace platforms. Staying on top of deadlines and completing daily to-do lists can be difficult, let alone spending an extensive amount of time to navigate a time-management app</p>

                <h3>Going back to old ways</h3>
                <p>Time management applications with various customization features can be overwhelming for users to set up and get adjusted to, often causing them to give up after a short period of time</p>

                <h3>Neglect of self care</h3>
                <p>When interviewing students, most said self care was not even on the list of priorities during school terms. Does self care and work only be mutually exclusive?</p>

            <h3>Dashboard - Before</h3>
            <p class="therefore">We discovered the need to edit and add widgets barely occurred in the later parts of a users journey and it was simply blocking space on their dashboard. The placement also made it easier to accidentally click on it with our mobile prototype. When asked to rank the priorities of the default widgets, responsive were very subjective and was difficult to meet all needs</p>
